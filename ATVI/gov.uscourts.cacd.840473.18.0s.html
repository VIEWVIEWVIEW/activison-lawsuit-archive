A. PURPOSES AND LIMITATIONS&#160;<br/>
23&#160;<br/>
As Plaintiff Activision Publishing, Inc.&#160;(“Plaintiff”) has represented, discovery&#160;<br/>
24&#160;<br/>
in this action is likely to involve production of confidential, proprietary, or private&#160;<br/>
25&#160;<br/>
information for which special protection from&#160;public&#160;disclosure&#160;and from use for any&#160;<br/>
26&#160;<br/>
purpose other than prosecuting this litigation may be warranted. &#160;Accordingly, this&#160;<br/>
27&#160;<br/>
Court enters the following Protective Order.&#160; This Order does not confer blanket&#160;<br/>
28&#160;<br/>
protections on all disclosures or responses to&#160;discovery. &#160;The protection it affords from&#160;<br/>1407<br/>

&#160;<br/>
public disclosure and use extends only to&#160;the limited information or items that are&#160;<br/>
1&#160;<br/>
entitled to confidential treatment under the applicable legal principles.&#160; Further, as set&#160;<br/>
2&#160;<br/>
forth in&#160;Section 12.3,&#160;below, this Protective&#160;Order does not entitle the parties to file&#160;<br/>
3&#160;<br/>
confidential information under seal. &#160;Rather,&#160;when the parties seek permission from&#160;<br/>
4&#160;<br/>
the court to file material under seal, the&#160;parties must comply with Civil Local Rule&#160;<br/>
5&#160;<br/>
79-5 and with any pertinent orders of the assigned District Judge and Magistrate&#160;<br/>
6&#160;<br/>
Judge.&#160;<br/>
7&#160;<br/>
B. GOOD CAUSE STATEMENT&#160;<br/>
8&#160;<br/>
In light of the nature of the claims and allegations in this case and Plaintiff’s&#160;<br/>
9&#160;<br/>
representation that discovery in this case will involve the production of confidential&#160;<br/>
10&#160;<br/>
records, and in order to expedite the flow&#160;of information, to facilitate the prompt&#160;<br/>
11&#160;<br/>
resolution of disputes over confidentiality&#160;of discovery materials, to adequately&#160;<br/>
12&#160;<br/>
protect information the parties&#160;are entitled to keep confidential, to ensure that the&#160;<br/>
13&#160;<br/>
parties are permitted reasonable necessary uses of such material in connection with&#160;<br/>
14&#160;<br/>
this action, to address their handling of such&#160;material at the end of the litigation, and&#160;<br/>
15&#160;<br/>
to serve the ends of justice, a protective order for such information is justified in this&#160;<br/>
16&#160;<br/>
matter. &#160;It is Plaintiff’s intent that&#160;any information/documents shall not be&#160;<br/>
17&#160;<br/>
designated as confidential without a&#160;good faith belief that such information/&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
documents have been maintained in a confidential, non-public&#160;manner, and that&#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
there is good cause or a compelling reason&#160;why it should not be part of the public&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<br/>
record of this case.&#160;<br/>

17&#160;<br/>
The protections conferred by this Order cover not only Protected Material (as&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
defined above), but also (1) any information copied or extracted from Protected&#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
Material; (2) all copies, excerpts, summaries, or compilations of Protected Material;&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
4. DURATION&#160;<br/>
1&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Even after final disposition of this&#160;litigation, the confidentiality obligations&#160;<br/>
2&#160;<br/>
imposed by this Order shall remain in&#160;effect until a Designating Party agrees&#160;<br/>
3&#160;<br/>
otherwise in writing or a court order otherwise directs. Final disposition shall be&#160;<br/>
4&#160;<br/>
deemed to be the later of (1) dismissal of all claims and defenses in this Action, with&#160;<br/>
5&#160;<br/>
or without&#160;prejudice; and (2) final judgment herein after the completion and&#160;<br/>
6&#160;<br/>
exhaustion of all appeals, rehearings, remands, trials, or reviews of this Action,&#160;<br/>
7&#160;<br/>
including the time limits for filing any motions or applications for extension of time&#160;<br/>
8&#160;<br/>
pursuant to applicable law.&#160;<br/>
9&#160;<br/>
5. DESIGNATING&#160;<br/>
PROTECTED&#160;<br/>
MATERIAL&#160;<br/>
10&#160;<br/>
5.1&#160;&#160;Exercise of Restraint and Care in&#160;Designating Material for Protection.&#160;<br/>
11&#160;<br/>
Each Party or Non-Party that designates information or items&#160;for protection under&#160;<br/>
12&#160;<br/>
this Order must take care to limit any such designation to specific material that&#160;<br/>
13&#160;<br/>
qualifies under the appropriate standards.&#160;The Designating Party must designate for&#160;<br/>
14&#160;<br/>
protection only those parts of material, documents, items, or oral or written&#160;<br/>
15&#160;<br/>
communications that qualify so that other portions of the material, documents,&#160;<br/>
16&#160;<br/>
items, or communications for which protection is not warranted are not swept&#160;<br/>
17&#160;<br/>
unjustifiably within the ambit of this Order.&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
Mass, indiscriminate, or routinized designations are prohibited.&#160;Designations&#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
that are shown to be clearly unjustified&#160;or that have been made for an improper&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<br/>
purpose (<i>e.g.</i>, to unnecessarily encumber the case development process or to impose&#160;<br/>
21&#160;<br/>
unnecessary expenses and burdens on other&#160;parties) may expose the Designating&#160;<br/>
22&#160;<br/>
Party to sanctions.&#160;<br/>
23&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
If it comes to a Designating Party’s attention that information or items that it&#160;<br/>
24&#160;<br/>
designated for protection do not&#160;qualify for protection, that Designating Party must&#160;<br/>
25&#160;<br/>
promptly&#160;notify all other Parties that it is&#160;withdrawing the inapplicable designation.&#160;<br/>

27&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
stipulated or ordered, Disclosure or Discovery Material that qualifies for protection&#160;<br/>
1&#160;<br/>
under this Order must be clearly so designated before the material is disclosed or&#160;<br/>
2&#160;<br/>
produced.&#160;<br/>
3&#160;<br/>
Designation in conformity with this Order requires:&#160;<br/>
4&#160;<br/>
(a) &#160;for information in documentary form&#160;(<i>e.g.</i>, paper or electronic&#160;<br/>
5&#160;<br/>
documents, but excluding transcripts of depositions), that the Producing Party affix&#160;<br/>
6&#160;<br/>
at a minimum, the legend “CONFIDENTIAL” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL --&#160;<br/>
7&#160;<br/>
ATTORNEYS’ EYES ONLY” to each page&#160;that contains protected material. &#160;If&#160;<br/>
8&#160;<br/>
only a portion or portions of the material&#160;on a page qualifies for protection, the&#160;<br/>
9&#160;<br/>
Producing Party also must clearly identify the protected portion(s) (<i>e.g.</i>, by making&#160;<br/>
10&#160;<br/>
appropriate markings in the margins).&#160;<br/>
11&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
A Party or Non-Party that makes original&#160;documents available for inspection&#160;<br/>
12&#160;<br/>
need not designate them for protection until&#160;after the inspecting Party has indicated&#160;<br/>
13&#160;<br/>
which documents it would like copied&#160;and produced. During the inspection and&#160;<br/>
14&#160;<br/>
before the designation, all of the material&#160;made available for inspection shall be&#160;<br/>
15&#160;<br/>
deemed “CONFIDENTIAL.”&#160;After the inspecting Party has identified the&#160;<br/>
16&#160;<br/>
documents it wants copied and produced,&#160;the Producing Party must determine which&#160;<br/>
17&#160;<br/>
documents, or portions thereof, qualify for protection under this&#160;Order. &#160;Then,&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
before producing the&#160;specified documents, the Producing Party must affix the&#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
“CONFIDENTIAL”, or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -- ATTORNEYS’ EYES&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<br/>
ONLY” legend to each page that contains&#160;Protected Material.&#160;&#160;If only a portion or&#160;<br/>
21&#160;<br/>
portions of the material on a page qualifies for protection, the Producing Party also&#160;<br/>
22&#160;<br/>
must clearly identify the protected portion(s) (<i>e.g.</i>, by making appropriate markings&#160;<br/>
23&#160;<br/>
in the margins).&#160;<br/>
24&#160;<br/>
(b) &#160;for testimony given in depositions that the Designating Party identifies&#160;<br/>
25&#160;<br/>
on the record, before the close of the&#160;deposition as protected testimony. &#160;<br/>
26&#160;<br/>
(c) &#160;for information produced in some form other than documentary and&#160;<br/>
27&#160;<br/>
for any other tangible items, that the Producing Party affix in a prominent&#160;place on&#160;<br/>
28&#160;<br/>

4&#160;<br/>
5.3&#160;&#160;Inadvertent Failures to Designate.&#160;&#160;If timely corrected, an inadvertent&#160;<br/>
5&#160;<br/>
failure to designate qualified information or items does not, standing alone, waive&#160;<br/>
6&#160;<br/>
the Designating Party’s right to&#160;secure protection under this Order for such material.&#160;<br/>
7&#160;<br/>
Upon timely correction of a designation, the Receiving Party must make reasonable&#160;<br/>
8&#160;<br/>
efforts to assure that the material is treated in accordance with the provisions of this&#160;<br/>
9&#160;<br/>
Order.&#160;<br/>
10&#160;<br/>
6. CHALLENGING&#160;<br/>
CONFIDENTIALITY&#160;<br/>
DESIGNATIONS&#160;<br/>
11&#160;<br/>
6.1&#160;&#160;Timing of Challenges. &#160;Any Party or Non-Party may challenge a&#160;<br/>
12&#160;<br/>
designation of confidentiality at any time&#160;that is consistent with the Court’s&#160;<br/>
13&#160;<br/>
Scheduling Order. &#160;<br/>
14&#160;<br/>
6.2&#160;&#160;Meet and Confer. &#160;The Challenging Party shall initiate the dispute&#160;<br/>
15&#160;<br/>
resolution process under Local Rule 37-1&#160;<i>et seq</i>. &#160;<br/>
16&#160;<br/>
6.3&#160;&#160;The burden of persuasion in any such&#160;challenge proceeding shall be on&#160;<br/>
17&#160;<br/>
the Designating Party. &#160;Frivolous challenges, and those made for an improper&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
purpose (<i>e.g.</i>, to harass or impose unnecessary&#160;expenses and burdens on other&#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
parties) may expose the Challenging Party&#160;to sanctions. &#160;Unless the Designating&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<br/>
Party has waived or withdrawn the confidentiality designation,&#160;all parties shall&#160;<br/>
21&#160;<br/>
continue to afford the material in question the level of protection to which it is&#160;<br/>
22&#160;<br/>
entitled under the Producing Party’s designation until the Court rules on the&#160;<br/>
23&#160;<br/>
challenge.&#160;<br/>
24&#160;<br/>
7.&#160;<br/>

14&#160;<br/>
that compels disclosure of any information or items designated in this Action as&#160;<br/>
15&#160;<br/>
“CONFIDENTIAL” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -- ATTORNEYS’ EYES&#160;<br/>
16&#160;<br/>
ONLY,” that Party must: &#160;<br/>
17&#160;<br/>
(a) &#160;promptly notify in&#160;writing the Designating Party. Such notification&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
shall include a copy of the subpoena or&#160;court order unless prohibited by law;&#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
(b) &#160;promptly notify in writing the party who caused the subpoena or order&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<br/>
to issue in the other litigation that some or all of the material covered by the&#160;<br/>
21&#160;<br/>
subpoena or order is subject to this Protective Order. &#160;Such notification shall include&#160;<br/>
22&#160;<br/>
a copy of this Protective Order; and &#160;<br/>

(c) &#160;cooperate with respect to all reasonable procedures sought to&#160;be&#160;<br/>
24&#160;<br/>
pursued by the Designating Party whose Protected Material&#160;may be affected.&#160;<br/>
25&#160;<br/>
If the Designating Party timely seeks a&#160;protective order, the Party served with&#160;<br/>
26&#160;<br/>
the subpoena or court order shall not produce any information designated in this&#160;<br/>

1&#160;<br/>
order issued, unless the Party has obtained the Designating Party’s permission, or&#160;<br/>

9. &#160;A NON-PARTY’S PROTECTED MATERIAL SOUGHT TO BE&#160;<br/>
8&#160;<br/>
PRODUCED IN&#160;THIS LITIGATION&#160;<br/>
9&#160;<br/>
(a) &#160;The terms of this Order are applicable to information produced by a&#160;<br/>
10&#160;<br/>
Non-Party in this Action and designated as “CONFIDENTIAL” or&#160;“HIGHLY&#160;<br/>
11&#160;<br/>
CONFIDENTIAL -- ATTORNEYS’ EYES ONLY.” &#160;Such information produced by&#160;<br/>
12&#160;<br/>
Non-Parties in connection with this litigation is protected by the remedies and relief&#160;<br/>
13&#160;<br/>
provided by this Order. &#160;Nothing in&#160;these provisions should be construed as&#160;<br/>
14&#160;<br/>
prohibiting a Non-Party from seeking additional protections. &#160;<br/>
15&#160;<br/>
(b) &#160;In the event that a Party is required, by a valid discovery request, to&#160;<br/>
16&#160;<br/>
produce a Non-Party’s confidential information in its possession, and the Party is&#160;<br/>
17&#160;<br/>
subject to an agreement with the Non-Party not to produce the Non-Party’s&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
confidential information, then the Party shall: &#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
(1) &#160;promptly notify in&#160;writing the Requesting Party and the Non-Party&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<br/>
that some or all of the information requested is subject to a confidentiality&#160;<br/>
21&#160;<br/>
agreement&#160;with a Non-Party;&#160;<br/>
22&#160;<br/>
(2) &#160;promptly provide&#160;the Non-Party with a copy of the Protective&#160;<br/>
23&#160;<br/>
Order in this Action, the relevant discovery request(s), and a reasonably specific&#160;<br/>
24&#160;<br/>
description of the information requested; and &#160;<br/>
25&#160;<br/>
(3) &#160;make the information requested available for inspection by the&#160;<br/>
26&#160;<br/>
Non-Party, if requested.&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
(c) &#160;If a Non-Party represented by counsel fails to commence the process&#160;<br/>
1&#160;<br/>
called for by Local Rules 45-1 and 37-1,&#160;<i>et seq.</i>&#160;within 14 days of receiving the&#160;<br/>
2&#160;<br/>
notice and accompanying information or fails contemporaneously to notify the&#160;<br/>
3&#160;<br/>
Receiving Party that it has done so,&#160;the Receiving Party may produce the Non-<br/>
4&#160;<br/>
Party’s confidential information responsive to the discovery request. &#160;If an&#160;<br/>
5&#160;<br/>
unrepresented Non-Party fails to seek a&#160;protective order from this court within 14&#160;<br/>
6&#160;<br/>
days of receiving the notice and accompanying information, the Receiving Party&#160;<br/>
7&#160;<br/>
may produce the Non-Party’s confidential information responsive to the discovery&#160;<br/>
8&#160;<br/>
request. &#160;If the Non-Party timely seeks a&#160;protective order, the Receiving Party shall&#160;<br/>
9&#160;<br/>
not produce any information in its possession or control that is subject to the&#160;<br/>
10&#160;<br/>
confidentiality agreement with the Non-Party before a determination by the court&#160;<br/>
11&#160;<br/>
unless otherwise required by the law or court&#160;order. &#160;Absent a court order to the&#160;<br/>
12&#160;<br/>
contrary, the Non-Party shall bear the&#160;burden and expense of seeking protection in&#160;<br/>
13&#160;<br/>
this court of its Protected Material.&#160;<br/>
14&#160;<br/>
10. UNAUTHORIZED&#160;<br/>
DISCLOSURE&#160;OF&#160;PROTECTED MATERIAL&#160;<br/>
15&#160;<br/>
If a Receiving Party learns that, by inadvertence or otherwise, it has disclosed&#160;<br/>
16&#160;<br/>
Protected Material to any person or in any circumstance not authorized under this&#160;<br/>
17&#160;<br/>
Protective Order, the Receiving Party must immediately (a) notify in writing the&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
Designating Party of the unauthorized disclosures, (b) use its best efforts to&#160;retrieve&#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
all unauthorized copies of the Protected Material, (c) inform the person or persons to&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<br/>
whom unauthorized disclosures were made of all the terms of this Order, and &#160;<br/>
21&#160;<br/>
(d) request&#160;such person or persons to execute the “Acknowledgment and Agreement&#160;<br/>
22&#160;<br/>
to Be Bound” (Exhibit A).&#160;<br/>
23&#160;<br/>
11. INADVERTENT&#160;<br/>
PRODUCTION OF PRIVILEGED OR&#160;<br/>
24&#160;<br/>
OTHERWISE PROTECTED MATERIAL&#160;<br/>
25&#160;<br/>
When a Producing Party gives notice to Receiving Parties that certain&#160;<br/>
26&#160;<br/>
inadvertently produced material is subject&#160;to a claim of privilege or other protection,&#160;<br/>
27&#160;<br/>
the obligations of the Receiving Parties are those set forth in Federal Rule of Civil&#160;<br/>
28&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
Procedure 26(b)(5)(B). &#160;This provision is&#160;not intended to modify whatever&#160;<br/>
1&#160;<br/>
procedure may be established in an e-discovery order that provides for production&#160;<br/>
2&#160;<br/>
without prior privilege review. &#160;Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 502(d) and&#160;<br/>
3&#160;<br/>
(e), insofar as the parties reach an agreement on the effect of disclosure of a&#160;<br/>
4&#160;<br/>
communication or information&#160;covered by the attorney-client privilege or work&#160;<br/>
5&#160;<br/>
product protection, the parties may incorporate their agreement into this Protective&#160;<br/>
6&#160;<br/>
Order.&#160;<br/>
7&#160;<br/>
12. MISCELLANEOUS&#160;<br/>
8&#160;<br/>
12.1&#160;&#160;Right to Further Relief. &#160;Nothing in&#160;this Order abridges the right of any&#160;<br/>
9&#160;<br/>
person to seek its modification by the Court in the future.&#160;<br/>
10&#160;<br/>
12.2&#160;&#160;Right to Assert Other Objections. &#160;No Party waives any right it&#160;<br/>
11&#160;<br/>
otherwise would have to object to disclosing or producing any information or item&#160;<br/>
12&#160;<br/>
on any ground not addressed in this Protective Order. &#160;Similarly, no Party waives&#160;<br/>
13&#160;<br/>
any right to&#160;object on any ground to use in&#160;evidence of any of the material covered&#160;<br/>
14&#160;<br/>
by this Protective Order.&#160;<br/>
15&#160;<br/>
12.3&#160;&#160;Filing Protected Material. &#160; A Party that seeks to file under seal any&#160;<br/>
16&#160;<br/>
Protected Material must comply with Civil Local Rule 79-5 and with any pertinent&#160;<br/>
17&#160;<br/>
orders of the assigned District Judge and Magistrate Judge. &#160; Protected Material may&#160;<br/>
18&#160;<br/>
only be filed under seal pursuant to a court order authorizing the sealing of the&#160;<br/>
19&#160;<br/>
specific Protected Material at issue. &#160;If a&#160;Party’s request to file&#160;Protected Material&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<br/>
under seal is denied by the court, then the Receiving Party may file the information&#160;<br/>
21&#160;<br/>
in the public record unless otherwise instructed by the court.&#160;<br/>
22&#160;<br/>
13. FINAL&#160;<br/>
DISPOSITION&#160;<br/>
23&#160;<br/>
After the final disposition of this Action,&#160;as defined in Section 4, within 60&#160;<br/>
24&#160;<br/>
