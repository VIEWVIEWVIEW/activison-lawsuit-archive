&#160;<br/>
1&#160;numerous malicious software products designed to enable members&#160;of the public to&#160;<br/>
2&#160;gain unfair competitive advantages (<i>i.e.</i>, to&#160;cheat) in&#160;the COD Games. &#160;These&#160;<br/>
3&#160;ongoing activities damage Activision’s games, its overall business, and the&#160;<br/>
4&#160;experience of the COD player community.&#160;<br/>
5<br/>
2.&#160;<br/>
EngineOwning (“EO”) is a commercial online business enterprise&#160;<br/>
6&#160;consisting of a German business entity and numerous individuals&#160;– including&#160;<br/>
7&#160;without limitation Defendants Valentin Rick, Leonard Bugla, Leon Frisch, Ignacio&#160;<br/>
8&#160;Gayduchenko, Marc-Alexander Richts, Alexander Kleeman, and several&#160;<br/>
9&#160;individuals&#160;acting under various aliases1&#160;– operating&#160;via the website&#160;<br/>
10&#160;http://www.engineowning.to (the “EO Website”). &#160;EO is engaged in the&#160;<br/>
11&#160;development, sale, distribution, marketing, and exploitation of&#160;a portfolio&#160;of&#160;<br/>
12&#160;malicious cheats and hacks for&#160;popular online multiplayer games, most&#160;<br/>
13&#160;prominently the COD Games. &#160;Via&#160;the EO Website and other related websites and&#160;<br/>
14&#160;social media accounts, EO and&#160;numerous affiliated individuals and resellers sell&#160;<br/>
15&#160;cheats for numerous COD Games, including without&#160;limitation&#160;<i>Call of Duty:&#160;</i><br/>
16&#160;<i>Warzone</i>,&#160;<i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</i>,&#160;<i>Call of Duty World War II</i>,&#160;<i>Call&#160;</i><br/>

18&#160;and&#160;<i>Call of Duty Black Ops III</i>&#160;(collectively, the “Cheating Software”). &#160;EO also&#160;<br/>
19&#160;claims&#160;to be developing new cheating software for the popular&#160;multiplayer game&#160;<br/>
20&#160;<i>Overwatch</i>, which is owned and&#160;published by&#160;Activision’s affiliate, Blizzard&#160;<br/>
21&#160;Entertainment, Inc. &#160;The Cheating&#160;Software enables players to manipulate the COD&#160;<br/>
22&#160;Games to their personal advantage, such as by automatically aiming weapons,&#160;<br/>
23&#160;revealing the locations of opponents, and allowing the player to see information&#160;<br/>
24&#160;that is not normally available to&#160;players because it would give&#160;them&#160;an unfair&#160;<br/>
25&#160;advantage within the game. &#160;&#160;<br/>

3.&#160;<br/>
The COD Games are designed to be enjoyed by and fair for all&#160;<br/>
2&#160;players. &#160;When players use exploits like the Cheating Software,&#160;such conduct&#160;<br/>
3&#160;disturbs game balance and in many cases leads non-cheating players to quit&#160;<br/>
4&#160;matches in frustration. &#160;Widespread cheating also can lead to negative social media&#160;<br/>
5&#160;posts and headlines in the press, which can impact consumer confidence. &#160;<br/>
6&#160;Accordingly, Activision has spent and continues to spend an enormous amount of&#160;<br/>
7&#160;resources to combat cheating in&#160;its games. &#160;Notwithstanding those efforts,&#160;<br/>
8&#160;Defendants’ sale and distribution&#160;of the Cheating Software has&#160;caused Activision&#160;<br/>
9&#160;to suffer&#160;massive and irreparable damage to its goodwill and reputation and to lose&#160;<br/>
10&#160;substantial&#160;revenue. &#160;&#160;<br/>
11<br/>
4.&#160;<br/>
In creating, marketing, selling, servicing, and distributing the&#160;<br/>
12&#160;Cheating Software, Defendants have engaged in numerous unlawful&#160;acts under&#160;<br/>
13&#160;United States and California law.&#160;&#160;Defendants have&#160;violated Section 1201 of the&#160;<br/>
14&#160;Digital Millennium&#160;Copyright Act&#160;(“DMCA”), 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1), by selling,&#160;<br/>
15&#160;importing, offering,&#160;providing, and otherwise trafficking in technologies that&#160;<br/>
16&#160;circumvent or evade anti-cheat technologies used by Activision&#160;to protect the&#160;<br/>
17&#160;integrity of the COD Games. &#160;Defendants also have knowingly, intentionally, and&#160;<br/>
18&#160;maliciously interfered with and&#160;disrupted the contracts Activision has with its&#160;<br/>
19&#160;customers in the United States, which explicitly prohibit the exact type of cheating&#160;<br/>
20&#160;that Defendants enable, encourage, and solicit by marketing and&#160;selling their&#160;<br/>
21&#160;Cheating Software. &#160;Defendants not&#160;only know that their conduct&#160;is unlawful, but&#160;<br/>
22&#160;they engage in that conduct with the deliberate intent to harm&#160;Activision, its&#160;<br/>
23&#160;businesses, and its player community. &#160;This Court must put a stop to Defendants’&#160;<br/>
24&#160;misconduct, and Activision is entitled to&#160;monetary damages, injunctive and other&#160;<br/>
25&#160;equitable relief, and punitive damages against Defendants.&#160;<br/>

<b>JURISDICTION AND VENUE&#160;</b><br/>
2<br/>
5.&#160;<br/>
This is a civil action seeking&#160;damages, injunctive relief, and&#160;other&#160;<br/>
3&#160;equitable relief under the anti-circumvention provisions of the&#160;DMCA, 17 U.S.C. §&#160;<br/>
4&#160;1201, and the laws of the State of California.&#160;<br/>
5<br/>
6.&#160;<br/>
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Activision’s claims for&#160;<br/>
6&#160;violating the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§&#160;<br/>
7&#160;1331 and&#160;1338(a). &#160;Pursuant to 28&#160;U.S.C. § 1367, this Court has&#160;supplemental&#160;<br/>
8&#160;jurisdiction over Activision’s state law claims for intentional&#160;interference with&#160;<br/>
9&#160;contract and unfair competition, which are so related to Activision’s federal claims&#160;<br/>
10&#160;as to be part of the same case or&#160;controversy. &#160;&#160;<br/>
11<br/>
7.&#160;<br/>
This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they&#160;<br/>
12&#160;have purposefully directed their&#160;activities at the United States, and at California in&#160;<br/>
13&#160;particular, have purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of doing business&#160;<br/>
14&#160;in California, and have established a continuing presence in California. &#160;Activision&#160;<br/>
15&#160;is informed and believes, and on that basis&#160;alleges, that, without limitation:&#160;<br/>
16<br/>
&#160;<br/>
(a)&#160;<br/>
Defendants conduct extensive and ongoing business with users&#160;<br/>
17&#160;in the State of California and the United States;&#160;<br/>
18<br/>
&#160;<br/>
(b)&#160;<br/>
Defendants target the Cheating Software to users in&#160;the United&#160;<br/>
19&#160;States, including in the State of&#160;California, knowing that a substantial market exists&#160;<br/>
20&#160;for their Cheating Software in&#160;the United States. &#160;For&#160;example,&#160;Defendants display&#160;<br/>
21&#160;all of the text of their website&#160;in “English (US),” offer special sales around U.S.&#160;<br/>
22&#160;holidays (such as Halloween and&#160;Black Friday), and provide customer service in&#160;<br/>
23&#160;English.&#160;<br/>
24&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
(c)&#160;<br/>
Defendants distribute the&#160;Cheating Software in the State&#160;of&#160;<br/>
25&#160;California, advertise and market the Cheating Software in the United States and the&#160;<br/>
26&#160;State of California, and communicate directly with users in the&#160;United States and&#160;<br/>
27&#160;in the State of California, including for the purposes of soliciting purchases of the&#160;<br/>

(d)&#160;<br/>
Defendants have entered into, and continue to enter into,&#160;<br/>
4&#160;contracts with individuals in the&#160;State of California, including&#160;contracts pursuant to&#160;<br/>
5&#160;which these individuals license&#160;from&#160;Defendants the right to install and use the&#160;<br/>
6&#160;Cheating Software. &#160;In return for&#160;such licenses, Defendants receive ongoing&#160;<br/>
7&#160;recurring&#160;daily, weekly, or monthly&#160;payments from individuals in the United States&#160;<br/>
8&#160;and the State of California; and&#160;<br/>
9<br/>
&#160;<br/>
(e)&#160;<br/>
Defendants contract with entities located in the State of&#160;<br/>
10&#160;California in connection with their businesses. &#160;This includes,&#160;for example, domain&#160;<br/>
11&#160;name&#160;registries, hosting or content delivery services, as well&#160;as credit card&#160;<br/>
12&#160;processors and merchant banks. &#160;In fact, Defendants boast on their website that&#160;<br/>
13&#160;they maintain at least&#160;two servers in the United States, including one in California:&#160;<br/>

<b>THE PARTIES&#160;</b><br/>
6<br/>
9.&#160;<br/>
Activision is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws&#160;<br/>
7&#160;of the State of Delaware, with&#160;its principal place of business&#160;in Santa Monica,&#160;<br/>
8&#160;California.&#160;<br/>
9<br/>
10.&#160;&#160;Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,&#160;that&#160;<br/>
10&#160;Defendants CMM Holdings S.A. and&#160;EngineOwning Software UG are&#160;German&#160;<br/>
11&#160;business entities headquartered in Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm&#160;(collectively, the&#160;<br/>
12&#160;“Corporate Defendants”). &#160;Activision is further informed and believes, and on that&#160;<br/>
13&#160;basis alleges, that the individual defendants develop, maintain, market, distribute,&#160;<br/>
14&#160;and sell the Cheating Software (including&#160;via the online “chat&#160;room” system&#160;<br/>
15&#160;known as “Discord”), and also operate and maintain the EO Website, through one&#160;<br/>
16&#160;or more of the Corporate Defendants.&#160;<br/>
17<br/>
11.&#160;&#160;Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,&#160;that&#160;<br/>
18&#160;Defendant Valentin Rick a/k/a Skyfail (“Rick”) is an individual&#160;residing in&#160;<br/>
19&#160;Germany who founded the Corporate Defendants, is the sole managing director&#160;<br/>
20&#160;and shareholder of the Corporate Defendants, and historically has been the primary&#160;<br/>
21&#160;administrator of the EO Website. &#160;Activision is further informed and believes, and&#160;<br/>
22&#160;on that basis alleges, that Rick&#160;has been and continues to be the&#160;de facto leader of&#160;<br/>
23&#160;EO, and in that capacity has directed and/or been responsible for developing,&#160;<br/>
24&#160;maintaining, marketing, distributing, and selling the Cheating&#160;Software. &#160;Activision&#160;<br/>
25&#160;previously contacted Rick in 2018&#160;and 2020 regarding his involvement with EO&#160;<br/>
26&#160;and the EO Website, and in response he claimed to have sold the&#160;EO Website to an&#160;<br/>
27&#160;unknown purchaser. &#160;Rick has never provided any evidence that such a sale took&#160;<br/>

4&#160;Defendant Leonard Bugla, a/k/a Reganmian and Noodleman (“Bugla”), is an&#160;<br/>
5&#160;individual residing in Germany who is listed as, and appeared to act as, an&#160;<br/>
6&#160;operations administrator of the EO Website in 2019 and 2020. &#160;Activision is&#160;<br/>
7&#160;further informed and&#160;believes, and on that basis alleges, that&#160;in this role Bugla&#160;<br/>
8&#160;enabled the development, maintenance, distribution, and sale of&#160;the Cheating&#160;<br/>
9&#160;Software. &#160;Activision is further&#160;informed and believes, and on&#160;that basis alleges,&#160;<br/>
10&#160;that Rick and Bugla have a long-standing personal relationship&#160;dating back to&#160;<br/>

4&#160;defendants include individuals whose real identities are not yet known to&#160;<br/>
5&#160;Activision, but who are acting in&#160;concert with one another, often under the guise of&#160;<br/>
6&#160;Internet aliases, in committing the unlawful acts alleged herein. &#160;Among the Doe&#160;<br/>
7&#160;defendants are developers, resellers, technical support staff,&#160;and other individuals&#160;<br/>
8&#160;who have participated in the development, sale, and distribution of the Cheating&#160;<br/>

10&#160;names and capacities once said defendants’ identities and capacities are&#160;<br/>
11&#160;ascertained. &#160;Activision is informed and believes, and on that&#160;basis alleges, that all&#160;<br/>
12&#160;defendants sued herein are liable&#160;to Activision as a result of&#160;their participation in&#160;<br/>
13&#160;all or some of the acts set forth in this complaint. &#160;(All of the aforementioned&#160;<br/>

<b>FACTS APPLICABLE TO ALL CLAIMS&#160;</b><br/>
22<br/>
23.&#160;&#160;Activision is the publisher and&#160;owner of the COD Games, which&#160;<br/>
23&#160;consist of&#160;over 15 video games released since 2003 on various video game&#160;<br/>
24&#160;platforms. &#160;The COD Games&#160;are&#160;released annually, with live operations and with&#160;<br/>
25&#160;additional&#160;downloadable content&#160;released&#160;regularly, and are consistently among the&#160;<br/>
26&#160;best-selling games in a given year, having sold over&#160;400 million total copies to&#160;<br/>
27&#160;date. &#160;In December 2020, Activision announced that the COD Games generated&#160;<br/>
Mitchell&#160;<br/>
28&#160;over $3 billion in net bookings in the prior 12 months.&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
1<br/>
24.&#160;&#160;The COD Games are “first-person&#160;shooter” video games that allow&#160;<br/>
2&#160;players to step into the shoes of&#160;soldiers&#160;and elite operators&#160;in combat throughout&#160;<br/>
3&#160;history, ranging from World War II to modern day and all the way into the future. &#160;<br/>
4&#160;Nearly all of the COD Games include single player campaign story modes which&#160;<br/>
5&#160;place players within a fictional narrative. However, all COD Games include the&#160;<br/>
6&#160;popular competitive online multiplayer modes, where players join online to play&#160;<br/>
7&#160;live together in real-time. &#160;Each of the COD Games offers as many as a dozen or&#160;<br/>
8&#160;more different online&#160;multiplayer game types, all of which are&#160;extremely intense as&#160;<br/>
9&#160;players compete to earn experience points, increase their rankings and statistics,&#160;<br/>
10&#160;and acquire various rewards for&#160;winning&#160;matches and achieving certain goals and&#160;<br/>
11&#160;objectives.&#160;<br/>
12<br/>
25.&#160;&#160;The COD Games’ online multiplayer modes are so popular that they&#160;<br/>
13&#160;have given rise to multiple competitive “esports” leagues and tournaments which&#160;<br/>
14&#160;attract several million viewers on streaming platforms such as&#160;Twitch and&#160;<br/>
15&#160;YouTube.&#160;<br/>
16&#160;&#160;<br/>
17<br/>
<b>The COD Games’ Business Model&#160;</b><br/>
18<br/>
26.&#160;&#160;Given the popularity&#160;and replayability of the COD Games’ online&#160;<br/>
19&#160;multiplayer modes, Activision works very hard to ensure that the COD Games&#160;<br/>
20&#160;offer consistently compelling player experiences so that customers will remain&#160;<br/>
21&#160;engaged in the COD Games, continue to play them&#160;for sustained periods&#160;of time,&#160;<br/>
22&#160;and be excited about future releases. &#160;&#160;<br/>
23<br/>
27.&#160;&#160;In March 2020, Activision released&#160;<i>Call of Duty: Warzone&#160;</i><br/>
24&#160;(“Warzone”), a free standalone multiplayer game&#160;that is offered&#160;to the public&#160;<br/>
25&#160;without requiring that&#160;the customer purchase a copy of any&#160;<i>Call of Duty</i>&#160;game. &#160;In&#160;<br/>
26&#160;order to play&#160;<i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i>, a member of the public must register an&#160;<br/>
27&#160;account with Activision, download the&#160;<i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i>&#160;software, and&#160;<br/>
Mitchell&#160;<br/>
28&#160;connect to Activision’s online multiplayer servers. &#160;Accordingly, the revenue&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
1&#160;Activision generates through&#160;<i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i>&#160;comes exclusively from sales&#160;<br/>
2&#160;of “virtual&#160;goods” (<i>i.e.</i>, weapons, skins, etc.) or seasonal “battle passes” that enable&#160;<br/>
3&#160;the player to receive in-game rewards for accomplishments within the game.&#160;<br/>
4<br/>
28.&#160;&#160;Revenue generated by the COD Games in turn helps&#160;pay for the&#160;<br/>
5&#160;enormous cost of updating, improving,&#160;maintaining, and serving&#160;the COD Games&#160;<br/>
6&#160;and their competitive online modes. &#160;If players perceive that a&#160;game is unfair,&#160;<br/>
7&#160;including because others are cheating or have an unfair advantage, players may&#160;<br/>
8&#160;grow frustrated with the COD Games, become less interested in playing&#160;and&#160;<br/>
9&#160;supporting them&#160;(including by&#160;purchasing&#160;new games and items) and may even&#160;<br/>
10&#160;stop playing entirely. &#160;Cheating&#160;therefore not only harms (and&#160;could even destroy)&#160;<br/>
11&#160;COD player communities, but also impacts Activision’s ability to offer the fast-<br/>
12&#160;paced, stable, high-quality online gameplay to which millions of fans have become&#160;<br/>
13&#160;accustomed. &#160;&#160;<br/>

15<br/>
<b>Activision’s Efforts To Protect&#160;Against&#160;Hackers And Cheaters&#160;</b><br/>
16<br/>
29.&#160;&#160;Because the COD Games are so popular, unscrupulous individuals&#160;<br/>
17&#160;and companies such as Defendants frequently&#160;seek to exploit the&#160;games for their&#160;<br/>
18&#160;own personal gain and profit by&#160;selling cheats, hacks, and other malicious&#160;<br/>
19&#160;software, knowing full well that they are ruining&#160;the experience for other players&#160;<br/>
20&#160;and harming Activision. &#160;For this reason, Activision undertakes&#160;significant efforts&#160;<br/>
21&#160;to protect the integrity of the&#160;COD Games through&#160;both technical and contractual&#160;<br/>
22&#160;means.&#160;<br/>
23<br/>
&#160;<br/>
24<br/>
Technical Protection&#160;<br/>
25<br/>
30.&#160;&#160;One way that Activision seeks to&#160;protect the COD Games from&#160;<br/>
26&#160;cheating or unauthorized exploitation, is by developing and employing anti-cheat&#160;<br/>
27&#160;technologies. &#160;These technologies help detect when players are&#160;using third party&#160;<br/>
Mitchell&#160;<br/>
28&#160;cheating software, and prevents&#160;unauthorized access to the COD&#160;Games by those&#160;<br/>

1&#160;players. &#160;It is not possible to&#160;play the COD Games’ online multiplayer modes (or to&#160;<br/>
2&#160;play&#160;<i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i>&#160;at all) without installing Activision’s anti-cheat&#160;<br/>
3&#160;technologies. &#160;Activision has been&#160;able to identify and ban hundreds of thousands&#160;<br/>
4&#160;of accounts using cheating software in the COD Games in just over the past year.&#160;<br/>
5<br/>
31.&#160;&#160;In order for any hack&#160;or cheat&#160;software to operate, it must be&#160;designed&#160;<br/>
6&#160;to prevent or avoid detection by&#160;the anti-cheat software, such&#160;as by concealing&#160;<br/>
7&#160;itself or by disabling&#160;the anti-cheat technology. &#160;Otherwise, the cheat will be&#160;<br/>
8&#160;detected and the user will be denied access to the particular game’s online&#160;<br/>
9&#160;multiplayer, and may be permanently banned from&#160;playing the game at all.&#160;<br/>

32.&#160;&#160;In order to access, download, or&#160;play the COD Games, users must&#160;<br/>
13&#160;create and register accounts with Activision. &#160;Upon first playing the COD Games&#160;<br/>
14&#160;and beginning installation, users&#160;must expressly manifest their&#160;assent to&#160;<br/>
15&#160;Activision’s Terms of&#160;Use (collectively, the “TOU”) by clicking&#160;through. &#160;If the&#160;<br/>
16&#160;user refuses to consent to the&#160;TOU, they cannot proceed and play the game.&#160;<br/>
17<br/>
33.&#160;&#160;The TOU includes a limited license agreement between Activision&#160;<br/>
18&#160;and its users. &#160;Under the TOU, Activision grants to users a “personal, limited, non-<br/>
19&#160;exclusive license” to use its games for “non-commercial use,” expressly&#160;<br/>
20&#160;conditioned upon the user’s compliance with the&#160;TOU. &#160;Among other provisions,&#160;<br/>
21&#160;by assenting to the TOU, users expressly agree not to “use, develop, host or&#160;<br/>
22&#160;distribute cheats, automation software (bots), modded lobbies,&#160;hacks, mods or any&#160;<br/>

•&#160;&#160;ESP and 2D/3D Radar, which allow the cheating player to visualize&#160;<br/>

opponents&#160;within the game in ways that destroy the integrity of&#160;the&#160;<br/>

12&#160;addition to marketing and distributing cheats (including but not limited to the&#160;<br/>
13&#160;Cheating Software), Defendants&#160;provide extensive and ongoing customer support&#160;<br/>
14&#160;and technical assistance, including through the forums&#160;on the EO Website, as well&#160;<br/>
15&#160;as by other means such as email and Discord.&#160;<br/>
16<br/>
39.&#160;&#160;Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,&#160;that the&#160;<br/>
17&#160;Cheating Software has been downloaded and used by players of the COD Games&#160;<br/>
18&#160;thousands of times by players residing in&#160;the United States. &#160;Activision also is&#160;<br/>
19&#160;informed and believes that Defendants have made hundreds of thousands of&#160;<br/>

24&#160;order for the Cheating Software&#160;to operate with the COD Games,&#160;the Cheating&#160;<br/>
25&#160;Software necessarily includes technology that primarily is designed to avoid,&#160;<br/>
26&#160;bypass, evade, or otherwise circumvent Activision’s anti-cheat&#160;technologies. &#160;<br/>

41.&#160;&#160;Defendants specifically and aggressively&#160;advertise and promote&#160;the&#160;<br/>
2&#160;Cheating Software as having been&#160;designed to circumvent Activision’s anti-cheat&#160;<br/>
3&#160;software. &#160;Product listings on the EO Website advertise that the Cheating Software&#160;<br/>
4&#160;offers “multiple protection layers against anti-cheats.” &#160;The listings also include&#160;<br/>
5&#160;certifications that the cheats&#160;will bypass and avoid detection&#160;by Activision’s anti-<br/>
6&#160;cheat software:&#160;<br/>

14<br/>
42.&#160;&#160;Each time a player uses the Cheating Software to cheat in the COD&#160;<br/>
15&#160;Games, he or she also violates&#160;Activision’s TOU, including those provisions that&#160;<br/>
16&#160;specifically prohibit&#160;players from “us[ing], develop[ing], host[ing]&#160;or distribut[ing]&#160;<br/>
17&#160;cheats, automation software (bots), modded lobbies, hacks, mods&#160;or any other&#160;<br/>
18&#160;unauthorized third-party software” in connection with Activision’s games “or&#160;<br/>
19&#160;engag[ing] in any form of cheating, boosting, or booting.” &#160;Accordingly,&#160;Activision&#160;<br/>
20&#160;is informed and believes, and on that basis&#160;alleges, that as a&#160;result of Defendants’&#160;<br/>
21&#160;conduct, at least tens of thousands of breaches of these contracts have occurred. &#160;&#160;<br/>
22<br/>
43.&#160;&#160;Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,&#160;that&#160;<br/>
23&#160;Defendants are fully aware that the use of the Cheating Software violates the TOU. &#160;<br/>
24&#160;For example, the EO Website prominently warns users that they can be “manually&#160;<br/>
25&#160;banned” by Activision for “obvious” cheating. &#160;This is a concern for players&#160;<br/>
26&#160;seeking to use the Cheating Software, because some advantages conferred by the&#160;<br/>
27&#160;Cheating Software may make player&#160;characters do things that appear unnatural or&#160;<br/>
Mitchell&#160;<br/>
28&#160;even physically impossible within&#160;the world of the game, such as quickly&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
1&#160;“snapping” aim to an opposing player with speed and accuracy beyond&#160;what even&#160;<br/>
2&#160;the most skilled player could achieve. &#160;Consequently, the EO Website stresses that&#160;<br/>
3&#160;the Cheating Software contains features designed to help avoid&#160;detection by the&#160;<br/>
4&#160;naked eye, including&#160;“Smooth Aim,” which slows down aim&#160;movement to make a&#160;<br/>
5&#160;player using an Aimbot appear to&#160;be moving naturally, and “Fire&#160;Delay,” which&#160;<br/>
6&#160;causes a player using a Triggerbot to wait before automatically&#160;shooting.&#160;<br/>
7<br/>
44.&#160;&#160;The Cheating Software has no purpose or function other than to&#160;<br/>
8&#160;enable players to violate the TOU by using cheats and exploits.&#160; Thus, Defendants’&#160;<br/>
9&#160;goal is to ensure that their customers continue to receive the&#160;benefits of their&#160;<br/>
10&#160;contracts with Activision while&#160;they simultaneously&#160;engage in continuing breaches&#160;<br/>
11&#160;of their obligations under these contracts.&#160;<br/>
12<br/>
45.&#160;&#160;On multiple occasions over the&#160;past few years, Activision has&#160;<br/>
13&#160;contacted or sought to contact some of the individuals suspected to be involved&#160;<br/>
14&#160;with EO and demanded that they cease and desist from&#160;any further development,&#160;<br/>
15&#160;maintenance, marketing, distribution, and sale of the Cheating&#160;Software. &#160;<br/>
16&#160;Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,&#160;that the Defendants&#160;<br/>
17&#160;in this action are and have been fully aware that their conduct&#160;violates Activision’s&#160;<br/>
18&#160;rights but&#160;nevertheless have brazenly continued their activities.&#160;<br/>
19<br/>
46.&#160;&#160;By their conduct, Defendants have caused and continue to cause&#160;<br/>
20&#160;serious harm to the COD Games and to Activision. &#160;Such harm is&#160;immediate,&#160;<br/>
21&#160;massive and irreparable, and includes (but is not limited to) the following:&#160;<br/>
22<br/>
&#160;<br/>
(a)&#160;<br/>
Defendants irreparably harm the ability of Activision’s&#160;<br/>
23&#160;legitimate customers to enjoy and&#160;participate in the online experiences&#160;carefully&#160;<br/>
24&#160;created by Activision. &#160;That, in&#160;turn, may cause users&#160;to grow&#160;dissatisfied&#160;with the&#160;<br/>
25&#160;COD Games, lose interest, and stop playing. &#160;&#160;<br/>
26<br/>
&#160;<br/>
(b)&#160;<br/>
Defendants’ knowing and willful misconduct has forced&#160;<br/>
27&#160;Activision to expend substantial&#160;resources attempting to remediate the damage&#160;<br/>
Mitchell&#160;<br/>
28&#160;caused by the Cheating Software. &#160;This includes creating and releasing updates to&#160;<br/>

9&#160;amount to millions of dollars. &#160;Unless and until Defendants are&#160;preliminarily or&#160;<br/>
10&#160;permanently enjoined, Activision&#160;will continue to suffer severe&#160;harm from the&#160;<br/>

54.&#160;&#160;As a result of the foregoing, Defendants are offering to the public,&#160;<br/>

8<br/>
63.&#160;&#160;As described herein, in order to&#160;install and play the COD Games,&#160;<br/>
9&#160;licensed users in the United States first must assent to Activision’s TOU.&#160;<br/>
10<br/>
64.&#160;&#160;Activision’s contracts with its&#160;users are valid and enforceable.&#160;<br/>
11<br/>
65.&#160;&#160;Each time a purchaser of the Cheating Software uses the Cheating&#160;<br/>
12&#160;Software in connection with the COD Games, he or she breaches the TOU. &#160;<br/>
13&#160;Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,&#160;that thousands of&#160;<br/>
14&#160;such breaches have taken place by Defendants’ customers.&#160;<br/>
15<br/>
66.&#160;&#160;Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,&#160;that&#160;<br/>

17&#160;between Activision and its users&#160;in the United States, including&#160;the TOU. &#160;<br/>
18&#160;Specifically, Defendants are aware that the TOU prohibits players from&#160;using the&#160;<br/>
19&#160;Cheating Software and that players are at risk of being banned&#160;from&#160;the COD&#160;<br/>
20&#160;Games should they&#160;be caught using&#160;the Cheating Software. &#160;Nevertheless,&#160;<br/>
21&#160;Defendants intentionally encourage and induce users of the COD&#160;Games to&#160;<br/>
22&#160;purchase and use the Cheating Software, knowing that the use of&#160;these products by&#160;<br/>
23&#160;their customers is a breach of these customers’ contracts with&#160;Activision. &#160;&#160;<br/>
24<br/>
67.&#160;&#160;By inducing Activision’s users to&#160;breach their contracts with&#160;<br/>

74.&#160;&#160;As a direct&#160;and proximate result&#160;of Defendants’ unfair competition in&#160;<br/>
2&#160;the United States, Activision has been damaged, and Defendants&#160;have been&#160;<br/>
3&#160;unjustly enriched, in an amount to be proven at trial for which&#160;damages and/or&#160;<br/>
4&#160;restitution and disgorgement is&#160;appropriate. &#160;Such damages and/or restitution and&#160;<br/>
5&#160;disgorgement should include a declaration by this Court that Defendants are&#160;<br/>
6&#160;constructive trustees for the benefit of Activision, and an order that Defendants&#160;<br/>
7&#160;convey to Activision the gross receipts received or to be received that are&#160;<br/>
8&#160;attributable to the sale of the&#160;Cheating Software in the United&#160;States.&#160;<br/>
9<br/>
75.&#160;&#160;Defendants are guilty of oppression, fraud or malice, and Activision,&#160;<br/>
10&#160;in addition to its actual damages, by reason thereof, is entitled to recover&#160;<br/>
11&#160;exemplary and punitive damages against Defendants.&#160;<br/>
12<br/>
76.&#160;&#160;As a result of Defendants’ acts&#160;and conduct in the United States,&#160;<br/>
13&#160;Activision has sustained and will&#160;continue to sustain substantial, immediate, and&#160;<br/>
14&#160;irreparable injury, for which there is no adequate remedy at law. &#160;Activision is&#160;<br/>
15&#160;informed and believes, and on that&#160;basis alleges, that&#160;unless enjoined and&#160;<br/>
16&#160;restrained by this Court, Defendants will continue to engage in&#160;unfair competition. &#160;<br/>
17&#160;Pursuant to California Business &amp; Professions Code § 17203, Activision is entitled&#160;<br/>
18&#160;to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting&#160;further acts of&#160;<br/>
19&#160;unfair competition.&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
21<br/>
<b>PRAYER FOR RELIEF&#160;</b><br/>
22<br/>
WHEREFORE, Activision prays that&#160;this Court enter judgment in its favor&#160;<br/>
23&#160;on each and&#160;every claim for relief set forth above and&#160;award it&#160;relief, including but&#160;<br/>
24&#160;not limited to an order:&#160;<br/>

12&#160;of Activision’s or affiliates’ rights, as described herein.&#160;<br/>
13<br/>
5.&#160;<br/>
Awarding&#160;Activision actual or maximum&#160;statutory damages for&#160;<br/>

8.&#160;<br/>
Awarding&#160;Activision restitution of Defendants’ unlawful proceeds,&#160;<br/>
22&#160;including an accounting of any&#160;and all sales of the Cheating Software in the United&#160;<br/>
23&#160;States, and/or any other products&#160;or services that violate any&#160;of Activision’s rights&#160;<br/>
